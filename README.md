## Project Sketch
A Raspberry Pi is setup with a microphone (or multiple microphones) to record sound samples in key locations of the Atlas Lobby.
It will have to be determined what interval sound samples are collected at such that it is not infringing on people's privacy.
The Raspberry Pi will either be loaded with local speech-to-text processing software or will offload the sound sample to an online API. The response from the software or API will be parsed to separate words, which will be uploaded to a database. The database will add new words or increase the count on existing words. The data can then be used to produce a visualization, such as a word cloud. If the data and visualization is kept online, a TV could be setup to display a webpage with the visualization, which is dynamically updated as new sound samples are processed.
It would be ideal if specific words are removed before being added to the database, such as articles and pronouns, leaving more interesting words for the visualization.

## Hardware
1. Raspberry Pi
2. Microphone(s)
3. RGB LED's for Visualization - Need to discuss further 
4. Hardware

## Roles
Given the varying expertise and interests, I'd like you to outline what team member will be responsible for what parts of the project.  It's okay if 2 people want to share certain responsibilities.  This is mostly for your own organization and, if things get rocky, so Mike knows who to talk to in the group.

## 4 Milestones
[Please list 4 Project Milestones you'll complete week-to-week to show your progress.  You will need to turn in some tangible example to prove you've completed 1 milestone each week.  Some combination of code snippets, data, screenshots, picture of the hardware setup, etc.  If these milestones need to change slightly, that's OK, as long as you tell Mike and Tom at least 2 days before submission (and as long as you haven't arbitrarily reduced the workload)]

## Propose 3 Meeting Times
1. Thursday 6 - 6:30pm

[You'll need to meet with Mike sometime during the week of 11/10 to finalize these details.  For this your whole team should try to be available for a **30 minute** meeting.  Mike is unavailable from 12-1 MWF and 12-2 TTh so don't propose those times.]


AND FINALLY... Remember to have fun!  This is going to be a challenging project, and there is going to be some tough hurdles, but it should be a good time if you get into it and get excited about what we're creating.  Mike will do his best to be available and around ATLAS so that in the evenings if students need to come in and work or try things, we can set times to do this.  Also we'll have a hardware expert [Abhishek Narula] from ATLAS who will help us in the process.
